### Implementation Patterns

#### Document Processing
- Stream-based processing for memory efficiency
- Chunk-based content splitting for RAG
- Metadata preservation throughout pipeline
- Error recovery and resumption capabilities

#### Image Handling
- Progressive optimization strategy
- Hash-based deduplication
- Lazy loading for large sets
- Format standardization pipeline

#### Parallel Processing
- Worker pool management
- Queue-based task distribution
- Progress tracking and reporting
- Resource-aware scaling

#### API Integration
- Rate limiting implementation
- Retry mechanisms with backoff
- Error handling and logging
- Configuration management

## Best Practices

### Code Style
- Use type hints for better maintainability
- Implement comprehensive logging
- Document public interfaces
- Use descriptive variable names

### Error Handling
- Implement graceful degradation
- Provide detailed error messages
- Log errors with context
- Support recovery mechanisms

### Performance
- Implement lazy loading where appropriate
- Use generators for large datasets
- Cache expensive operations
- Monitor resource usage

### Testing
- Unit tests for core functionality
- Integration tests for API interactions
- Performance benchmarks
- Error case coverage

## Architecture Guidelines

### Component Design
1. Single Responsibility Principle
   - Each module handles one aspect of processing
   - Clear interfaces between components
   - Minimal coupling between modules

2. Configuration Management
   - External configuration files
   - Environment variable support
   - Command-line interface
   - Sensible defaults

3. Processing Pipeline
   - Clear data flow
   - Progress tracking
   - Error handling at each stage
   - Recovery points

4. Resource Management
   - Controlled resource allocation
   - Proper cleanup
   - Memory usage monitoring
   - CPU utilization tracking

### Integration Patterns

#### OpenAI Integration
- API key management
- Model configuration
- Request rate limiting
- Response handling

#### File System Integration
- Safe file operations
- Atomic writes
- Directory management
- Path sanitization
