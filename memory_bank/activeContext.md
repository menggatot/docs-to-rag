[2024-02-19 00:41 UTC+7]

## Current Focus
- Memory Bank initialization
- System architecture documentation
- Project structure organization

## Active Components
1. Documentation Processing
   - MD/MDX file handling
   - Content optimization
   - Metadata management

2. Image Processing
   - Size optimization
   - Format conversion
   - Vision API integration

3. System Integration
   - OpenAI API connectivity
   - Parallel processing implementation
   - Output generation

## Open Questions
1. What is the optimal chunk size for RAG processing?
2. How should we handle complex MDX components?
3. What are the best practices for image description generation?
4. How can we optimize the parallel processing for different system capabilities?

## Current Goals
1. Complete core system documentation
2. Establish clear processing patterns
3. Define image handling best practices
4. Document API integration patterns

## Notes
- System is in initial setup phase
- Core functionality is defined
- Need to document technical decisions and patterns
