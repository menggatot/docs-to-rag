# Project Brief: Docs to RAG Processor

## Overview
Docs to RAG Processor (docs-to-rag) is a Python utility designed to process Markdown (MD) and MDX files for use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems. The tool focuses on preparing documentation for AI-powered knowledge bases by processing content, optimizing images, and maintaining metadata.

## Core Requirements
1. Process MD/MDX files from specified directories
2. Handle and optimize images within documentation
3. Maintain document metadata and structure
4. Support parallel processing for efficiency
5. Provide detailed logging and progress tracking
6. Integrate with OpenAI API for enhanced features

## Project Goals
- Simplify documentation preparation for RAG systems
- Ensure efficient processing of large documentation sets
- Maintain content integrity while optimizing media assets
- Provide clear progress tracking and error reporting
- Enable scalable processing through parallelization

## Success Metrics
1. Successful processing of all MD/MDX files
2. Proper handling and optimization of embedded images
3. Maintenance of document structure and metadata
4. Clear error reporting and logging
5. Performance optimization through parallel processing
