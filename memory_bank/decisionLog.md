# Decision Log

## [2024-02-19] - Core Architecture Decisions

### Python as Primary Language
**Context:** Need for efficient document processing and image handling
**Decision:** Use Python 3.x as the primary implementation language
**Rationale:**
- Strong text processing capabilities
- Rich ecosystem of libraries
- Excellent parallel processing support
- Good integration with AI services
**Implementation:** Core system implemented in Python with modular architecture

### Image Processing Strategy
**Context:** Need to handle various image formats and sizes for RAG processing
**Decision:** Implement smart compression with format standardization
**Rationale:**
- OpenAI API has 20MB limit
- Need to maintain image quality while reducing size
- Standardization improves processing reliability
**Implementation:**
- Accept JPEG and PNG inputs
- Convert all outputs to JPEG
- Implement hash-based storage system

### Parallel Processing Implementation
**Context:** Need to handle large documentation sets efficiently
**Decision:** Implement worker-based parallel processing
**Rationale:**
- Improves processing speed for large datasets
- Better resource utilization
- Scalable architecture
**Implementation:**
- Configurable number of workers
- Default to 4 workers
- Queue-based task distribution

### OpenAI Vision API Integration
**Context:** Need reliable image analysis capabilities
**Decision:** Use gpt-4o-mini as default vision model
**Rationale:**
- Good balance of performance and cost
- Reliable image analysis capabilities
- Configurable for different needs
**Implementation:**
- Base64 image encoding
- Rate limiting support
- Configurable model selection

### File Processing Architecture
**Context:** Need to handle MD/MDX files effectively
**Decision:** Implement streaming processing with metadata preservation
**Rationale:**
- Memory efficient
- Maintains document structure
- Preserves important metadata
**Implementation:**
- Streaming file processing
- Metadata extraction and preservation
- Structured output generation
