# Product Context

## Project Overview
Docs to RAG Processor is a specialized Python utility designed to streamline the preparation of documentation for AI-powered knowledge bases. The tool focuses on processing Markdown (MD) and MDX files while handling images and metadata intelligently for optimal use in Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) systems.

## Core Objectives
1. Simplify documentation processing for RAG systems
2. Optimize image handling and processing
3. Maintain metadata integrity
4. Provide efficient parallel processing
5. Enable seamless OpenAI Vision API integration

## Technical Stack
- Python 3.x based implementation
- OpenAI API integration (Vision capabilities)
- Parallel processing architecture
- Image processing and optimization system

## Key Features
- MD/MDX file processing
- Intelligent image handling and optimization
- Metadata preservation
- Parallel processing capabilities
- OpenAI Vision API integration
