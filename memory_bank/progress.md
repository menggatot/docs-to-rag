## In Progress
- [ ] System patterns documentation
- [ ] Technical decision logging
- [ ] Architecture optimization strategies
- [ ] Performance benchmarking plans

## Next Steps
### Short Term
1. Document core architectural decisions
2. Establish system patterns and conventions
3. Define image processing optimization strategies
4. Create benchmarking framework

### Medium Term
1. Implement parallel processing optimizations
2. Enhance image processing capabilities
3. Improve metadata handling
4. Develop advanced configuration options

### Long Term
1. Scale system for larger documentation sets
2. Integrate additional AI model support
3. Enhance error handling and recovery
4. Develop monitoring and analytics

## Known Issues
1. Need to define optimal chunk sizes for RAG
2. Complex MDX component handling strategy required
3. Image processing optimization parameters to be determined

## Dependencies
